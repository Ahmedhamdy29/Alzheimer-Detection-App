# Explainable CNN-Based Alzheimer's MRI Classification with Streamlit Deployment

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of the **Graduation Project** requirements.  
The aim is to develop a **deep learning pipeline** for classifying Alzheimer’s Disease stages using **MRI brain scans**. The model was trained using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and deployed as an **interactive Streamlit web application**.  

The classifier predicts the stage of Alzheimer’s and provides confidence scores.  

> **Note**: Due to time constraints, only **Milestone 1** and **Milestone 3** were implemented.  
> (Milestone 2 – Grad-CAM Explainability – was not included).

## 🚀 Milestones Implemented  

### ✅ Milestone 1 — Data & Baseline CNN  
- Loaded dataset using `tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory`.  
- Computed **class weights** to handle class imbalance.  
- Built a **CNN model** (Sequential API).  
- Training protocol:  
  - `ModelCheckpoint` & `EarlyStopping`.  
  - Plotted learning curves (loss & accuracy).  
- Evaluation:  
  - Reported test accuracy & loss.  
  - Generated classification report & confusion matrix.  

### ❌ Milestone 2 — Explainable AI (Grad-CAM)  
- *Not implemented in this submission.*  

### ✅ Milestone 3 — Streamlit Deployment  
Built an **interactive web app** that allows users to:  
- Upload an MRI image (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`).  
- Get predicted class + confidence scores.  
- See class probabilities.  
- Display results in a clean, user-friendly UI.
